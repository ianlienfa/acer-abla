\section{Empirical Evaluation}
\label{section:evaluation}
Please showcase your empirical results in this section. Please clearly specify which sets of experiments of the original paper are considered in your report. Please also report the corresponding hyperparameters of each experiment.


1. remove the entropy term
2. remove \emph{trust region constraint}
In the environment of CartPole and MountainCarContinuous, the removal of trust region constraint from the algorithm seems to be better, especially in the MountainCarContinuous environment.
3. drop the bias term 
In both environment, the result with bias term dropped turns out to be significantly worse.
4. remove the clamping on the actor loss
The elimination of the function causes a deterioration of the performance. 
5. change the \emph{truncation parameter}
It appears that the results of each corresponding hyperparameters are almost the same in the last few episodes.
6. change $Q_opc$ to $Q_ret$ 
The result of the state action value replacement is worse as we can see in Figure ? 
7. change $Q_ret$ to $Q_opc$
The result of the state action value replacement is also worse, and the reward would not change after some episode.
8. change the power term of truncated importance weight from $1/d$ to $1 / e^d$
The reward after we alter the truncation importance weight form $1/d$ to $1 / e^d$ is better. The result is summarized in Figure ?
9. replace sdn structure to two independent networks
