\section{Detailed Implementation}
\label{section:implementation}
Please explain your implementation in detail. You may do this with the help of pseudo code or a figure of system architecture. Please also highlight which parts of the algorithm lead to the most difficulty in your implementation.


As for the part of ablations, we conduct the following alterations. 

1. remove the entropy term
2. consider the parameter TRUST_REGION_CONSTRAINT
3. drop the bias term 
4. remove the clamping on the actor loss
5. change the TRUNCATION_PARAMETER
6. change Q_opc to Q_ret 
7. change Q_ret to Q_opc
8. change the power term of truncated importance weight from 1/d to 1 / e^d 
9. replace sdn structure to two independent networks

1~5 are conducted under both discrete and continuous environments, while 6~9 are only considered under continuous environment.
